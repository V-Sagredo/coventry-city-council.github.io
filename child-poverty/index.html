<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">
The research was carried out on behalf of End Child Poverty by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University, led by Professor Donald Hirsch.<br/><br/>
A child is said to live in poverty if they are in a family living on less than 60% of median household income.  According to the latest official statistics 60% of median income (after housing costs) was around £248 per week. To find the relevant poverty line for a particular household type, this then needs to be adjusted to take account of household size.  For a couple with two children under 14 this means multiplying by 1.4 – giving a poverty line of £347 per week.<br/><br/>
The figures presented here are estimates of child poverty in different areas, calculated using HMRC data and the Labour Force Survey. These estimates aren’t directly comparable with the HBAI figure of 3.9 million children in poverty in the UK, due to different methodologies and rounding.<br/><br/>
The local data has been produced to correspond as closely as possible to the measure of low income used by the government in its regional and national data. However, direct comparisons between the two data sets should not be made.
